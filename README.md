<h1>SRT Editor</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What this app does:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Can open any subtitle files, recommended ones are .srt</li>
	<li>Can save in ".SRT" only!</li>
	<li>Can move the subtitles with any given ofset using shortcut or going there through the edit menu strip</li>
	<li>Can edit any given line and save it to the stack</li>
	<li>Can delete lines that you tell it to delete, if you confirm it.</li>
	<li>Automatically keeps the line number in sync with removal of any subtitle.</li>
	<li>I haven't added a functionality that makes creation of .srt files possible, but will do if there is such request by users.</li>
	<li>I am currently thinking of a feature that would make the subtitles editable throughout, just clicking next on the edit window</li>
</ul>
